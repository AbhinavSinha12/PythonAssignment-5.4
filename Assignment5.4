Data Analysis Assignement 5.4

Problem Statement
Given a sequence of n values x1, x2, ..., xn and a window size k>0, the k-th moving
average of the given sequence is defined as follows:
The moving average sequence has n-k+1 elements as shown below.
The moving averages with k=4 of a ten-value sequence (n=10) is shown below
i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
===== == == == == == == == == == ==
Input 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
y1     25 = (10+20+30+40)/4
y2         35 = (20+30+40+50)/4
y3             45 = (30+40+50+60)/4
y4                 55 = (40+50+60+70)/4
y5                     65 = (50+60+70+80)/4
y6                         75 = (60+70+80+90)/4
y7                             85 = (70+80+90+100)/4

Thus, the moving average sequence has n-k+1=10-4+1=7 values.

Solution

import numpy as np
dataset = np.asarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])  # the given sequence of value
ma = list()
window = 4  #here the k size is 4
for t in range(0, len(dataset)):
    if t+window <= len(dataset):
        indices = range(t, t+window)
        ma.append(np.average(np.take(dataset, indices)))  #take te average of Compute the weighted average along the specified axis
else:
    ma = np.asarray(ma)

print(ma)

[ 2.5  3.5  4.5  5.5  6.5  7.5  8.5]
